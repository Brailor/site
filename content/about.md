# My Journey to become a DevOps Engineer

I know I know, DevOps is ideally not a specific role rather than a culture, where IT professionals have one specific goal in front of them: delivering value to the customer as fast as possible.

My purpose with this blog/site is to document my journey diving deep first in the fundamentals of software development (OS concepts, Linux, shell/bash scripting, git) and later on I will try to learn modern tools and concepts related to DevOps (cloud computing, AWS, IaC etc.).

Given the fact that I'm already working as a Software Engineer for 5 years now, I know a lot of stuff, but my knowledge is rather focused in a specific area of SW as of right now (Web development, Frontend Development). Ultimately my goal is to widen my knowledge as much as possible and grasp deeper knowledge in the above mentioned topics.
